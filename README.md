# Innioasis Y1 Themes for Original System Menus

## To submit a theme to this repository for listing on the themes directory, simply fork the repository and then submit a PR with your themes info added to its config.json file and any screenshots you'd like to show included in the folder as screenshot.jpg, screenshot2.jpeg screenshot.gif for example - you can include a series of screenshots if you wish. animated gifs will show first in theme previews.

You can specify information about your theme by adding the below to your themes config.json - this will be parsed by the theme directory - perhaps use the URL to showcase an online portfolio, a website your theme's reddit post, or perhaps a cause you care about, specifying this information is optional and I'll aim to add themes and credits where I see them myself also - If you do of course not want a theme listed please submit a PR or email teamslide@proton.me for removal.
