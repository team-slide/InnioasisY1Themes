# Innioasis Y1 Themes for Original System Menus - 

# To submit a theme to this repository for listing on the themes directory you can do it


# Via Google Drive
You upload your theme folder to this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6ztowRCbqww6LSOetUM9oUS9v10IKeF?usp=drive_link) taking care to add information and screenshots if you have the time (Optional - I'll put descriptions on the current themes and take screenshots soon - although you're welcome to submit your own edits, descriptions and URL as you please)

# Via GitHub
simply fork the repository and then add your information and screenshots

# How to add information and screenshots.

When uploading the theme folder in plase if you can, add info to its config.json file (or include it in a text file and I can help place the info in your config.json file for you :)

and add any screenshots you'd like to show included in the folder as screenshot.jpg, screenshot2.jpeg screenshot.gif for example - you can include a series of screenshots if you wish. animated gifs will show first in theme previews.

You can manually add information about your theme by adding the below to your themes config.json - this will be parsed by the theme directory - perhaps use the URL to showcase an online portfolio, a website your theme's reddit post, or perhaps a cause you care about

```
{
    "theme_info": {
        "title": "My Theme",
        "author": "John Doe",
        "authorUrl": "https://johndoe.com",
        "description": "A gorgeous theme for the Innioasis Y1 inspired by..."
    },
```

# Collation of existing themes
I will try and add and document authors for themes where I find them online, if of course you do not wish for your theme to be listed on https://themes.innioasis.app or on the Google Drive or repo, please don't hesitate to contact us at teamslide@proton.me or submit an issue on this repository.
